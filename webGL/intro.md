#### intro

webGl is a library that allow you to take benefits of your GPU, run complex algorithms on the gpu for it parallel nature.

#### openGl Shading Language

OpenGL Shading Language is a high-level shading language with a syntax based on the C programming language. It was created by the OpenGL ARB to give developers more direct control of the graphics pipeline without having to use ARB assembly language or hardware-specific languages. it compiles on the cpu, really really fast. 

#### three.js 

is a high level framework that take sit on top of GLSL and webGL.

> it's a good idea to create one geometry and multiple meshes from them. you can also work with units other that px, like modeling a cup with cm or meters...

#### create custom textures

to find images that can be mapped on a sphere look for **EquiRectangular images** or **HDR maps**
or **envirenement textures**, physically based texturing **pbr** 

#### what is a shader?  

is a tiny little program that run in parallel on the gpu.
